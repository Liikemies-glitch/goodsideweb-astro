                        <span class="faq-question">Why is interaction data analysis critical for SaaS products?</span>
                        <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
                    </div>
                    <p class="faq-answer">For SaaS companies, interaction data analysis directly impacts revenue by identifying optimization opportunities throughout the customer lifecycle. With subscription-based models, understanding exactly how users engage with your product helps you improve activation rates, increase feature adoption, enhance user satisfaction, and reduce churn. Even small improvements in these metrics can significantly impact your ARR and growth trajectory.</p>

                        <span class="faq-question">What analysis methods do you use and when?</span>
                        <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
                    </div>
                    <p class="faq-answer">We employ multiple methodologies based on your specific goals. For conversion optimization, we use funnel analysis, drop-off identification, and A/B test analysis. For engagement insights, we leverage feature usage tracking, session analysis, and behavioral cohort comparisons. For retention improvements, we utilize survival analysis, churn prediction modeling, and feature impact assessment. Each approach is selected to address your most pressing business questions.</p>

                     <div class="faq-question-wrapper">
                        <span class="faq-question">How much historical data do you need for meaningful analysis?</span>
                        <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
                    </div>
                    <p class="faq-answer">For most analyses, 3-6 months of data provides sufficient context to identify patterns while remaining relevant to your current product. For seasonal businesses, we recommend at least 12 months of data to account for cyclical variations. The minimum data requirements depend on your user volume—high-traffic products can yield insights more quickly than those with lower user counts. We can work with what you have while helping you implement better tracking for future analysis.</p>

                        <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
                    </div>
                    <p class="faq-answer">We're tool-agnostic and experienced with most major analytics platforms including Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Amplitude, Heap, Pendo, and Segment. We can work with your existing implementation or recommend appropriate tools based on your needs. For specialized analyses, we may use additional tools like Hotjar for heatmaps and session recordings, Fullstory for user frustration detection, or custom SQL queries against your product database.</p>

                        <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
                    </div>
                    <p class="faq-answer">A focused analysis examining specific user journeys or features typically takes 2-3 weeks from kickoff to final recommendations. More comprehensive product-wide analysis generally requires 4-6 weeks. The timeline includes setup and data validation (1 week), analysis (1-3 weeks), and reporting/recommendation development (1 week). For ongoing analysis partnerships, we establish regular reporting and insight delivery cadences aligned with your development cycles.</p>

                    <p class="faq-answer">We establish clear before/after metrics tied to your business goals.

                        <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
                    </div>
                    <p class="faq-answer">The ideal times for analysis are: 1) When launching new features to measure adoption and impact, 2) When experiencing unexpected changes in key metrics like conversion or churn, 3) Before major redesigns to establish baselines and identify opportunities, 4) During growth phases to optimize acquisition and activation funnels, and 5) Regularly as part of continuous improvement cycles. The most successful SaaS companies integrate analysis ongoing rather than as isolated projects.</p>
