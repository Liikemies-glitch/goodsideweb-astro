        "The outdated look and functionalities of the user interfaces do not meet the needs of modern users, which has made it difficult to maintain customer satisfaction and challenging to expand internationally. Media advertising was no longer profitable, and product-led growth units were not operating optimally.",
        "A tight budget and the need for quick results create pressure to make the right decisions on the first attempt. This is particularly important as previous development projects have not yielded the expected outcomes. This has increased the company\'s caution and made finding a reliable partner a primary objective."

        "To understand users\' daily activities, the most common use cases were defined, serving as the basis for UI improvements. User paths and scenarios were carefully mapped to ensure development work addressed real needs.",
        "Additionally, a competitor analysis was conducted to identify Nettilasku\'s strengths and areas for development in the market. This provided valuable information for enhancing usability and customer experience. Business objectives, such as product profitability and customer relationship sustainability, were integrated into the development work to make the service both attractive and financially sound."

Navigation and visual guidance were enhanced by adding clear elements, such as arrows and animations, making it easier to find important functions.",
        "To clarify navigation, active tabs were emphasized, and scrolling functionalities were improved. Communication was enhanced by clarifying messages and notifications both visually and structurally, making them more understandable and easily accessible.",
        "Revamping the access rights logic enabled the management of multiple company accounts with a single user profile, offering users flexibility and ease. Additionally, product package pricing was reviewed to attract broader user groups.",
        "During the project, regular weekly meetings and active communication on instant messaging platforms kept all parties updated on development progress. Appointing a UI/UX specialist and the development work led by Tuomas Kaartoluoma clarified responsibilities and brought consistency to the work."

        "The free-to-paid conversion doubled, demonstrating the new user interface\'s effectiveness in customer engagement. According to forecasts, the redesign will generate approximately €180,000 in revenue for Eemel in 2025, a significant increase compared to before."
