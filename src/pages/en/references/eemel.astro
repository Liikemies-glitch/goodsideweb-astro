      <p>Eemel.com (formerly Nettilasku.fi) had built a solid foundation as a financial management solution for small businesses since 2010. Their platform offers essential tools for invoicing, payroll, time tracking, and automated accounting. With the rebranding to Eemel.com, the company set its sights on conquering international markets.</p>
      
      <p>However, their outdated user interface had become their biggest obstacle. The poor user experience was directly impacting business metrics – reducing customer loyalty, lowering conversion rates, and driving users to competitors with more modern solutions.</p>
