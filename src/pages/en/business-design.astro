                    </div>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Business design applies design thinking to business strategy and operations. It combines market analysis, customer insights, and strategic planning to create business models, processes, and value propositions that drive growth.

                    </div>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Strategic business design directly impacts key performance metrics through improved market positioning (typically 15-30% revenue growth), streamlined operations (20-40% efficiency gains), stronger value propositions (increased conversion rates of 25-50%), and better resource allocation. In competitive markets, comprehensive business design is often the difference between market leaders and followers.</p>
