                        <span class="faq-question">Why is user research essential for SaaS products?</span>
                        <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
                    </div>
                    <p class="faq-answer">For SaaS companies, user research is crucial because it directly impacts key metrics like acquisition, activation, retention, and expansion revenue. With subscription-based models, understanding user needs ensures you're building features that drive long-term value and prevent churn. It also significantly reduces development waste by focusing resources on solving real user problems rather than assumed ones.</p>

                        <span class="faq-question">What research methods do you use and when?</span>
                        <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
                    </div>
                    <p class="faq-answer">We employ a mix of methods based on your specific questions and constraints. For discovery, we use in-depth interviews, contextual inquiry, and diary studies. For validation, we conduct usability testing, prototype testing, and preference testing. For measurement, we leverage analytics reviews, surveys, and benchmark studies. Each method is strategically chosen to answer your most critical questions in the most efficient way.</p>

                        <span class="faq-question">How many users do you need to include in research?</span>
                        <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
                    </div>
                    <p class="faq-answer">For qualitative methods like usability testing, 5-8 participants per user segment typically uncovers 85-90% of major issues. For discovery interviews, we usually recommend 8-12 participants per segment to reach insight saturation. For quantitative research like surveys, sample size depends on your user base size and desired confidence level, but we typically aim for statistical significance with a 95% confidence level.</p>

                        <span class="faq-question">How do you recruit research participants?</span>
                        <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
                    </div>
                    <p class="faq-answer">We use multiple recruitment channels depending on your needs. For existing products, we can recruit directly from your user base through in-app invitations, email campaigns, or customer lists. For new products or reaching non-users, we leverage specialized research recruitment panels, social media recruitment, and industry-specific networks. We handle all screening, scheduling, and incentive management.</p>

                        <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
                    </div>
                    <p class="faq-answer">A focused usability study can be completed in 2-3 weeks from kickoff to final report. More comprehensive discovery research typically takes 4-6 weeks. The timeline includes planning (1 week), recruitment (1-2 weeks), research sessions (1-2 weeks), and analysis/reporting (1 week). We can expedite certain projects with rapid research techniques when decisions are time-sensitive.</p>

                    <p class="faq-answer">We conduct both remote and in-person research based on your needs. Remote research offers broader geographic reach, faster timelines, and often lower costs. In-person research provides richer contextual insights and works better for certain populations or when physical interactions with products are important. We'll recommend the best approach based on your research goals, timeline, and budget.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="faq-answer">We track both direct and indirect ROI metrics. Direct metrics include development time saved by avoiding unwanted features, increased conversion from improved onboarding, and reduced churn from fixing pain points.

                    </div>
                    <p class="faq-answer">The ideal times for research are: 1) Before starting design or development to validate product concepts, 2) During design iterations to refine solutions, 3) Before major releases to catch issues, 4) After launch to measure success and identify improvements, and 5) Periodically to stay connected with evolving user needs. The most successful SaaS companies integrate research continuously throughout their product development cycle.</p>
