                    </div>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Product design for SaaS encompasses the complete process of creating digital products that meet user needs while achieving business goals. It combines user research, strategic thinking, interaction design, and visual execution to deliver an effective and cohesive product experience optimized for subscription-based software.</p>

                        <span class="faq-question">How does product design impact SaaS business metrics?</span>
                        <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
                    </div>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Well-executed product design directly influences key SaaS metrics through higher conversion rates (typically 2-4x improvement), increased user engagement, reduced churn (10-30% improvement), and lower support costs. In today's competitive SaaS environment, exceptional product design is often the primary differentiator between market leaders and competitors.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Timelines depend on project scope. A focused product design audit typically takes 2-3 weeks. A comprehensive product redesign involving user research, mapping, prototyping, and UI design usually requires 8-12 weeks. Complex products with multiple user roles may require longer timeframes to ensure all use cases are optimized for maximum effectiveness.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="faq-answer">The best times to invest in product design are: 1) Before developing new features to ensure market fit, 2) When metrics show increasing churn or poor adoption rates, 3) When competing in crowded markets where differentiation is crucial, 4) When preparing to scale or enter new markets, or 5) When your product has evolved without strategic design direction.</p>
