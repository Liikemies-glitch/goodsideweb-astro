# What is Service Design? (en)

Placeholder content: This is the English version of the blog post discussing the fundamentals of service design.

Service design is the activity of planning and organizing people, infrastructure, communication and material components of a service in order to improve its quality and the interaction between the service provider and its customers. Service design may function as a way to inform changes to an existing service or create a new service entirely.

The purpose of service design methodologies is to establish best practices for designing services according to both the needs of customers and the competencies and capabilities of service providers. If a successful method of service design is adapted there will be a service that is user-friendly and relevant to the customers, while being sustainable and competitive for the service provider.
